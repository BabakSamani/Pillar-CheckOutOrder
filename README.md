# Pillar-codingChallenge-checkoutOrder
A coding challenge for creating Test-Driven Development with Java. Based on my understanding of Kata Problem Solving
and programming, four steps should be taken in developing an application with this method, design, develop, test and 
produce.

This challenge is about developing a check out process that can calculate the total cost of an order that includes a 
list of items. Some items in the order might have markedDown or special offers that would effect the total cost. 

Design

> Need to have Items or products, need to have Orders for each customer. An arrayList to create the order that enables 
us for removing any item from order list.\
> markedDownItems pool includes items that have discount. An arrayList to create this pool.\
> Need to have CheckOut process. In this step the calculation will be applied.
